# EECE 487 Robotics: Forward Kinematics

Part 1 of 3

The project involved the modeling of a 6-degree-of-freedom SCARA robot in Matlab Simulink. All sections controlled the model arm using a Novint Falcon controller.

Part 1 used forward kinematics to map the controller position to the joint angles, and used Matlab to calculate and display the end-effector position. (As well as the position of the rest of the arm)

The collection of files is not functional, as it is missing the config files specific to the lab setup.
